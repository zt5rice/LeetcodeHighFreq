The idea is the following:

we will build an array mem where mem[i+1][j+1] means that S[0..j] contains T[0..i] that many times as distinct subsequences. Therefor the result will be mem[T.length()][S.length()].
we can build this array rows-by-rows:
the first row must be filled with 1. That's because the empty string is a subsequence of any string but only 1 time. So mem[0][j] = 1 for every j. So with this we not only make our lives easier, but we also return correct value if T is an empty string.
the first column of every rows except the first must be 0. This is because an empty string cannot contain a non-empty string as a substring -- the very first item of the array: mem[0][0] = 1, because an empty string contains the empty string 1 time.
So the matrix looks like this:

  S 0123....j
T +----------+
  |1111111111|
0 |0         |
1 |0         |
2 |0         |
. |0         |
. |0         |
i |0         |
From here we can easily fill the whole grid: for each (x, y), we check if S[x] == T[y] we add the previous item and the previous item in the previous row, otherwise we copy the previous item in the same row. The reason is simple:

if the current character in S doesn't equal to current character T, then we have the same number of distinct subsequences as we had without the new character.
if the current character in S equal to the current character T, then the distinct number of subsequences: the number we had before plus the distinct number of subsequences we had with less longer T and less longer S.
An example:
S: [acdabefbc] and T: [ab]

first we check with a:

           *  *
      S = [acdabefbc]
mem[1] = [0111222222]
then we check with ab:

               *  * ]
      S = [acdabefbc]
mem[1] = [0111222222]
mem[2] = [0000022244]
And the result is 4, as the distinct subsequences are:

      S = [a   b    ]
      S = [a      b ]
      S = [   ab    ]
      S = [   a   b ]
