1353. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended
Medium

Given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]. Every event i starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi.

You can attend an event i at any day d where startTimei <= d <= endTimei. Notice that you can only attend one event at any time d.

Return the maximum number of events you can attend.

 

Example 1:


Input: events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can attend all the three events.
One way to attend them all is as shown.
Attend the first event on day 1.
Attend the second event on day 2.
Attend the third event on day 3.
Example 2:

Input: events= [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]
Output: 4
Example 3:

Input: events = [[1,4],[4,4],[2,2],[3,4],[1,1]]
Output: 4
Example 4:

Input: events = [[1,100000]]
Output: 1
Example 5:

Input: events = [[1,1],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[1,6],[1,7]]
Output: 7
 

Constraints:

1 <= events.length <= 105
events[i].length == 2
1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 105

Solution 1
Sort events increased by start time.
Priority queue pq keeps the current open events.

Iterate from the day 1 to day 100000,
Each day, we add new events starting on day d to the queue pq.
Also we remove the events that are already closed.

Then we greedily attend the event that ends soonest.
If we can attend a meeting, we increment the result res.


Complexity
Time O(d + nlogn), where D is the range of A[i][1]
Space O(N)
